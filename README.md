# 2D-Heat-Equation

This project uses MATLAB to solve the 2D heat equation,
detailing the methodology and analysis of results. It will
utilize the finite difference method to approximate
temperature distribution in a thin rectangular plate.

We have 3 Matlab files for our code: "explicit.m", "implicit.m", "visualize.m"


The first 2 files plot out some figures to see the changes of temperature of some points on the plate by time in both explicit and implicit method. We also compare between the results of 11x11 and 21x21 input matrix.


The "visualize.m" file is for simulating the temperature distribution on the square material using the Explicit Scheme with 21x21 resolution.
